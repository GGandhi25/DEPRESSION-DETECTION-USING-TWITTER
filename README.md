# DEPRESSION-DETECTION-USING-TWITTER
Detecting Depression Related Tweets using Neural Networks

The dataset was found on Kaggle. The data is in unsanitized format and collected using the Twitter API. Tweets have been filtered to retain only English context. It targets user mental health classifications at the Tweet level.
However, for the Keras Recurrent Neural Network models, I have used a technique called LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation) to assign labels to the dataset. Latent Dirichlet allocation is one of the most popular methods for performing topic modeling. Each document consists of various words and each topic can be associated with some words. The aim behind the LDA is to find topics that the document belongs to, based on the words contained in it. It assumes that documents with similar topics will use a similar group of words. This enables the documents to map the probability distribution over latent topics and topics are probability distribution. I wanted to determine if I will observe any change in accuracy as compared to the SAME dataset, but with pre-assigned labels. Hence, the CNN model is built and trained as per the originally downloaded file with labels.
